#### Understanding Data Structures in Python
#### In Python programming, data structures are fundamental components that allow you to store, organize, and manipulate data efficiently. Here, we explore four key data structures: lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries, each with unique characteristics and use cases.

1)Lists
Lists are ordered collections of items, where each item is indexed starting from 0. They are mutable, meaning their elements can be changed after creation.

2)Tuples
Tuples are similar to lists but are immutable, meaning once created, their elements cannot be changed. They are typically used for fixed collections of elements.

3)Sets
Sets are unordered collections of unique elements. They are useful for tasks that involve membership testing and eliminating duplicates from a collection.

4)Dictionaries
Dictionaries are collections of key-value pairs, where each key is unique and maps to a corresponding value. They are efficient for accessing, inserting, and deleting items based on their keys.
